The issue and ethical conundrum with equality of outcome is that those who advocate for this ideal want everyone to end up on the same level, hence the advocacy for equal redistribution of results, regardless of merit, effort, or individual differences. They do this seeking systemic mechanisms that they think will guarantee uniformity of result rather than equality of opportunity.

Perhaps they mean well, envisioning a world free of suffering and class divides, where historical injustices are remedied by enforced parity. Yet someone in full possession of full human DNA should recognise that this ideal without a doubt, is myopic and will only soil the cause of genuine fairness by conflating uniformity with equity.

â€¦ geez! A world where everyone ends up the same would be dreadfully monotonous and boring, free from the very chaos that makes our world unique, wouldn't you agree? The vibrancy of human experience, our triumphs, our struggles, and our creative flourishes, all emerging from the interplay of difference, free will, freedom, and responsibilities and not from enforced sameness.
