⭐ I recently released a paper and presented same at the 6th IFAC conference, Romania. To see the paper, [check here for Hand-Eye-Object Tracking for Human Intention Inference ](https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/328102345/Hand_Eye_Object_Tracking_for_Human_Intention_Inference_final.pdf), a novel learning-based human intention inference from a fusion of 3 visual cues.

⭐ I am currently working on Self-Learn-Your-Key Gaze (*SLYKGaze*), A Gaze Estimation Technique that minimizes domain expertise limitation and aleatoric uncertainties in learning-based gaze estimation. 

⭐ I will be joining [Belfast Metropolitan College](https://www.belfastmet.ac.uk/) in September 2022 as a Part-Time Lecturer in Machine Learning, and Part-Time Lecturer in Python. 

⭐ In July 2022, our ethics application was accepted, hence we are set to collect the first-of-its-kind dataset.
