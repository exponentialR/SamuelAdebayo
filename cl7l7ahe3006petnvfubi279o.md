Finally got around to publishing my first Python package and it is for basic computer vision tasks. 

Over the last couple of months, I realised that I have had to write the same codes all over again and manually do some tasks that I could have easily automated. These usually lead to a lot of boilerplate codes. Being the curious mind that I am- I decided to write a package that I could easily install on my PC and run these tasks whenever I so desire. I can also plug this package as part of a larger project code base. 

So, here is introducing ``[Ormedian-Utils](https://pypi.org/project/ormedian-utils/#description)`` a python package for basic CV tasks.

As of now ``ormedian-utils`` can do the following

- Save frames from videos, camera feed or a folder containing more than one video.
- move specific files from myriads of other files.
- Resize images in folders or multiple folders.

Read the docs [here](https://github.com/exponentialR/ormedian-utils) .

I hope you find the package useful.
