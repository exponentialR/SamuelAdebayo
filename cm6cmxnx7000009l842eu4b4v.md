From June 2023 to January 2024, our team at the Centre for Intelligent Autonomous Manufacturing Systems, Queen’s University Belfast, conducted an extensive data collection project aimed at advancing human intention inference. Our goal was to validate the hypothesis that incorporating multiview, multimodal visual signals, especially fine-grained ones, can enhance the prediction of human intentions with precision down to the nearest second.

QUB-PHEO (Queen’s University Belfast, Perception of Human Engagement in Assembly Operations) is designed to support advanced research in human intention inference and engagement analysis. Our dataset provides a foundation for developing and testing innovative models and applications in this domain.

**Project Highlights:**  
`Data Volume`: Over 4.5 million 4K frames and 40+ hours of video data  
`Tasks`: 9 tasks and 36 subtasks  
`Participants`: 70 individuals contributing diverse perspectives

We have thoroughly documented our methodology, approach, and core principles in our recently published paper in IEEE Access. You can access the \[paper here\](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10731700\]

Our datasets and preprocessing code are open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/exponentialR/QUB-HRI)
